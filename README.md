# NGlory-House-Price-Forecasts
This project revolves around the concept of housing price prediction. A dedicated Machine Learning model is used to make these predictions. The primary highlight of this project is the usage of Jupyter notebook cells, which are exposed as REST Endpoints. This capability allows the model to make predictions with new information.
